Publication title: Shorter treatment for minimal tuberculosis (TB) in children (SHINE) The SHINE trial is the first randomised-controlled clinical trial designed specifically to test the efficacy of shortened treatments for children diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB). The trial’s primary concern was drug-susceptible TB that is considered minimal. This type of TB is responsive to treatment through medication, unlike drug-resistant TB, and is thought to be less severe. The trial was funded by the UK’s department of health and social care, and the country’s department for international development’s Joint Global Health Trials Scheme, the Wellcome Trust, and the Medical Research Council (UK). University College London sponsored and coordinated the trial. The TB Alliance provided additional support. Final data from the trial along with a summary report of the trial’s results are yet to be published.
