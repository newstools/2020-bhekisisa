Resource details: Bhekisisa Webinar, AVAC factsheet, UNAids fact sheet. Publication title: HIV and mental health: The impact of lifelong medication, stigma and discrimination. What the webinar is about: Over the past three decades, an HIV-positive diagnosis has evolved from being a death sentence to a manageable chronic condition. But that doesn’t mean living with the virus is without its challenges. This webinar examines the experiences of three people with HIV who have worked their way through stigma, the side-effects of antiretroviral treatment and living with a chronic condition. Bhekisisa’s editor-in-chief, Mia Malan, is in conversation with the prominent HIV clinician, Sindisiwe Van Zyl, and nurse clinician, Lebalang Angela Motsusi, who lives with HIV. Also on the panel are Thanduxolo Doro of the HIV non-profit, the MenStar Coalition, and activist Saidy Brown, who found out she was born with HIV when she was 14 years old. Brown lost both her parents to the virus. Watch the full webinar here. Download the Avert fact sheet here. Download the UNaids report on HIV and stigma here.
